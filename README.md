# Team 4152 2026 Robot

## Season Goals
- nearly optimal auto alignment (TOPP-RA + PID feedback?)
- state machine subsystem runtime for simplicity and encapsulation
- game piece tracking for automating intake actions
- auto turret tracking/scoring 

## Inspiration
- state machine subsystems by Jack in the Bot (team 2910)
- looking into [TOPP-RA](https://www.chiefdelphi.com/t/auto-align-using-time-optimal-path-parameterization/509513) because of Rembrandts (team 4481)
- General inspiration from Mechanical Advantage (team 6328)
